# TigerML

This is an implementation of the "Modern compiler implementation in ML" book.
its done in OCaml to resemble the original implmementation as much as possible while I am
learning the concepts.

This readme is mainly to remind me of how to run my own project and to keep track of my progress.


```bash
# clean
dune clean

# build
dune build

# To run the project
dune exec tigerml
```
